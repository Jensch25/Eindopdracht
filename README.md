## Description

Having specific dietary wishes for my meals, (No pork, only fish with scales and fins, No cow milk) I am always looking for ingredients that fit my diet. Planning my daily diner, means time-consuming, dissecting every product I use. This application will save you from all that.

This application compiles recipe(s) based upon the ingredient you put into the search field. The application also lets the user select from a list with different dietary options, (supplied by the FOOD API Edamam). By submitting your preferences, the application supplies recipeâ€™s for your main course and presents the option to store 7 recipes in a recipe planner. The user has to be signed in to use the dietary recipe manager.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project, so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
